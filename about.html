<p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[12][15] The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[16] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[17]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[18] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.[19] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[20][21]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[22]</p>
